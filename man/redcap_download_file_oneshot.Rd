\title{Download a file from a REDCap project record.}
\usage{
redcap_download_file_oneshot(file_name = NULL, directory = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE, redcap_uri, token, record, field, event = "",
  verbose = TRUE, config_options = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{The name of the file where the downloaded file is saved.
If empty the original name of the file will be used and saved in 
the default directory.  Optional.}

\item{directory}{The directory where the file is saved. By default current directory. Optional}

\item{overwrite}{Boolean value indicating if existing files should be overwritten. Optional}

\item{redcap_uri}{The URI (uniform resource identifier) of the REDCap project.  Required.}

\item{token}{The user-specific string that serves as the password for a project.  Required.}

\item{record}{The record ID where the file is to be imported. Required}

\item{field}{The name of the field where the file is saved in REDCap. Required}

\item{event}{The name of the event where the file is saved in REDCap. Optional}

\item{verbose}{A boolean value indicating if \code{message}s should be printed to the R console during the operation.  Optional.}

\item{config_options}{A list of options to pass to \code{POST} method in the \code{httr} package.  See the details below. Optional.}
}
\value{
Currently, a list is returned with the following elements,
\enumerate{
 \item \code{success}: A boolean value indicating if the operation was apparently successful.
 \item \code{status_code}: The \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes}{http status code} of the operation.
 \item \code{outcome_message}: A human readable string indicating the operation's outcome.
 \item \code{records_affected_count}: The number of records inserted or updated.
 \item \code{affected_ids}: The subject IDs of the inserted or updated records.
 \item \code{elapsed_seconds}: The duration of the function.
 \item \code{raw_text}: If an operation is NOT successful, the text returned by REDCap.  If an operation is successful, the `raw_text` is returned as an empty string to save RAM.
 \item \code{file_name}: The name of the file persisted to disk. This is useful if the name stored in REDCap is used (which is the default).
}
}
\description{
This function uses REDCap's API to download a file
}
\details{
The `REDCapR' package includes a recent version of the \href{http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem}{Bundle of CA Root Certificates} 
from the official \href{http://curl.haxx.se}{cURL site}.  This version is used by default, unless the `cert_location` parameter is given another location.

Currently, the function doesn't modify any variable types to conform to REDCap's supported variables.  See \code{\link{validate_for_write}} for a helper function that checks for some common important conflicts.
