\title{Export the metadata of a REDCap project.}
\usage{
redcap_metadata_read(redcap_uri, token, forms = NULL, forms_collapsed = "",
  fields = NULL, fields_collapsed = "", verbose = TRUE,
  config_options = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{redcap_uri}{The URI (uniform resource identifier) of the REDCap project.  Required.}

\item{token}{The user-specific string that serves as the password for a project.  Required.}

\item{forms}{An array, where each element corresponds to the REDCap form of the desired fields.  Optional.}

\item{forms_collapsed}{A single string, where the desired forms are separated by commas.  Optional.}

\item{fields}{An array, where each element corresponds to a desired project field.  Optional.}

\item{fields_collapsed}{A single string, where the desired field names are separated by commas.  Optional.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean value indicating if \code{message}s should be printed to the R console during the operation.  The verbose output might contain sensitive information (\emph{e.g.} PHI), so turn this off if the output might be visible somewhere public. Optional.}

\item{config_options}{A list of options to pass to \code{POST} method in the \code{httr} package.  See the details in \code{redcap_read_oneshot()} Optional.}
}
\value{
Currently, a list is returned with the following elements,
\enumerate{
 \item \code{data}: An R \code{data.frame} of the desired records and columns.
 \item \code{success}: A boolean value indicating if the operation was apparently successful.
 \item \code{status_codes}: A collection of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes}{http status codes}, separated by semicolons.  There is one code for each batch attempted.
 \item \code{outcome_messages}: A collection of human readable strings indicating the operations' semicolons.  There is one code for each batch attempted.  In an unsuccessful operation, it should contain diagnostic information.
 \item \code{forms_collapsed}: The desired records IDs, collapsed into a single string, separated by commas.
 \item \code{fields_collapsed}: The desired field names, collapsed into a single string, separated by commas.
 \item \code{elapsed_seconds}: The duration of the function.
}

\description{
Export the metadata (as a data dictionary) of a REDCap project as a \code{data.frame}.  
Each row in the data dictionary corresponds to one field in the project's dataset.
}
\details{
Specifically, it internally uses multiple calls to \code{\link{redcap_read_oneshot}} to select and return data.
Initially, only primary key is queried through the REDCap API.  The long list is then subsetted into partitions,
whose sizes are determined by the \code{batch_size} parameter.  REDCap is then queried for all variables of
the subset's subjects.  This is repeated for each subset, before returning a unified \code{data.frame}.

The function allows a delay between calls, which allows the server to attend to other users' requests.
